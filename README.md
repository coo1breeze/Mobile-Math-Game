# Mobile-Math-Game

NOTICE: GitHub did not like the size of the project, so there will be a delay until I work around that.

This was what I made for the final project of my ITS 440 class. 

Made with Xamarin, you choose the difficulty you want, and the operator, and you are given math problems. The points you gain/lose are tracked, and their are adjustable settings.
